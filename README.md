# Pompeii
Hackathon 2016 game

Pompeii is a multiplayer boardgame where players compete in mini games to advance spaces. Each victory triggers an Arduino to turn on another LED on the game board and the first one to reach the last spot wins!
The mini games are fast paced and don't give a lot of instruction so part of the game is figuring out how to play them. You have to think fast and decide between arrow keys, mouse, space bar, or keyboard in order to win each game. Each game has its own little quirks and once you learn them they become easier to complete.

Good luck and enjoy the craziness that is Pompeii!


To play you will need objectDraw which can be found here: http://www.cs.pomona.edu/classes/cs051/handouts/eclipse-install.html
To just play the mini games without the board, comment out the SerialPort stuff
